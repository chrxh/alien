        drawHeading2("How does a simple self-replicating organism work?");
        drawParagraph("In general, an organism in ALIEN consists of a network of cells where the cells work together by communicating with each other through "
                      "activity signals.");
        drawParagraph(
            "A simple creature first needs a constructor cell that contains its genome and is responsible for self-replication. The constructor cell "
            "is automatically triggered and generates (as soon as enough energy is available) the cell network of the offspring built cell by cell as described in "
            "its genome. The genome for the offspring is also copied and placed into the constructor cell of the offspring.");
        drawParagraph(
            "Self-replication requires energy, which must be obtained in some way. On the one hand, energy can be acquired by the absorption of "
            "energy particles flying around. This can be the main source of energy for plant-like species. On the other hand, there is the possibility to utilize "
            "attacker cells. They can attack cells from other organisms by stealing energy from them. If an attacker cell is part of the creature, it must be "
            "explicitly triggered by an activity signal. This signal may come, for example, from another cell equipped with a neural network. The energy "
            "obtained by an attacker cell is distributed to nearby constructor or transmitter cells.");
        drawParagraph("To perform movements, an organism requires muscle cells. These are also controlled by activity signals. Muscle cells can work in "
                      "various modes: they can bend, contract/expand, or generate an impulse.");
        drawParagraph("For the perception of the environment, sensor cells are available. When such a cell is triggered by activity signals, it provide "
                      "information about the relative position of cell concentrations with respect to a specific color, which can be further processed by e.g. "
                      "cell with neural network.");

        drawHeading2("Why does the radiation source generates no energy particles?");
        drawParagraph("The principle of energy conservation holds true in a simulation, which means that energy particles cannot spontaneously come into "
                      "existence out of nothingness. This principle plays a vital role in ensuring the stability of long-term simulations. If a radiation "
                      "source is defined, it will emit a particle only when a cell somewhere loses energy. Conversely, in the absence of a radiation source, "
                      "any emitted energy particle would originate directly in the spatial vicinity of the corresponding cell.");
        drawParagraph("The existence of matter in the form of cells is a prerequisite for the radiation source to emit particles. Furthermore, the simulation "
                      "parameters should be adjusted in a way that guarantees a gradual loss of energy from cells over time.");

        drawHeading2("How can neural networks be incorporated?");
        drawParagraph("Neural networks are available as cell functions. If a cell is assigned the function 'Neuron', it possesses a small neural network "
                      "consisting of 8 neurons. However, these networks can be interconnected to form arbitrarily large networks, as each cell receives input "
                      "from the output of certain connected cells.");
        drawParagraph("Furthermore, these networks can be fed by sensors and, in turn, control muscle and attacker cells.");

        drawHeading2("For how long should I run a simulation to see evolutionary changes?");
        drawParagraph(
            "This depends on many factors: On the size of the simulated world, on the mutation rates, on various selection pressures that can be influenced "
            "by the simulation parameters and on the self-replication duration. Usually one should wait for several dozen generations, which may correspond to hundreds of thousands or million time steps."
            "In small worlds with smaller organisms and high mutation rates, evolutionary changes can sometimes be observed every minute depending on the hardware. With more complex "
            "simulations, you should rather expect a few hours.");

        drawHeading2("How can I add energy to a simulation?");
        drawParagraph("Adding energy to a simulation can increase the available resources and thus the population. There is a convenient way to directly feed "
                      "all constructor cells with additional energy. This can be achieved by enabling the 'External Energy Control' addon in the simulation "
                      "parameter window. Next, set the amount of energy to be added (for instance, 1M could sustain 10K cells if each cell has 100 energy "
                      "units). The external energy is not added instantly but at a rate that can be specified under 'inflow'.");

        drawHeading2("How can I create a cell activity in the first place?");
        drawParagraph("To activate a cell function, an input from a connected cell in the form of non-zero activity states is required. The simplest methods "
                      "to generate an non-zero activity state are as follows:");
        drawItemText("The most direct approach involves using a nerve cell that generates an activity pulse at regular time intervals. The advantage here is that "
            "you can precisely configure the length of the time intervals.");
        drawItemText("Activities can also be generated within a neuron cell using bias values.");
        drawParagraph("Additionally, other cells such as constructor cells provide an activity output as soon as they are triggered (automatically).");

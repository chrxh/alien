<p>
<b><i>A</i></b>rtificial <b><i>LI</i></b>fe <b><i>EN</i></b>vironment <b>(ALIEN)</b> is an artificial life simulation tool based on a specialized 2D particle engine in CUDA for soft bodies and fluids. Each simulated body consists of a network of particles that can be upgraded with higher-level functions, ranging from pure information processing capabilities to physical equipment (such as sensors, muscles, weapons, constructors, etc.) whose executions are orchestrated by neural networks. The bodies can be thought of as agents or digital organisms operating in a common environment. Their blueprints can be stored in genomes and passed on to offspring.
</p>
<p>
The simulation code is written entirely in CUDA and optimized for large-scale real-time simulations with millions of particles.
The development is driven by the desire to better understand the conditions for (pre-)biotic evolution and the growing complexity of biological systems.
An important goal is to make the simulator user-friendly through a modern user interface, visually appealing rendering and a playful approach.

- Download and upload simulation files
- Upvote simulations by giving stars

# ‚ùì But for what is this useful
- A first attempt to answer: Feed your curiosity by watching evolution at work! As soon as self-replicating machines come into play and mutations are turned on, the simulation itself does everything.
- Perhaps the most honest answer: Fun! It is almost like a game with a pretty fast and realistic physics engine. You can make hundreds of thousands of machines accelerate and destroy with the mouse cursor. It feels like playing god in your own universe with your own rules. Different render styles and a visual editor offer fascinating insights into the events. There are a lot of videos on the [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCtotfE3yvG0wwAZ4bDfPGYw) for illustration.
- A more academic answer: A tool to tackle fundamental questions of how complexity or life-like structure may arise from simple components. How do entire ecosystems adapt to environmental changes and find a new equilibrium? How to find conditions that allow open-ended evolution?
- A tool for generative art: Evolution is a creative force that leads to ever new forms and behaviors.

# üìò Documentation
A documentation for the previous major version, which introduces the reader to the simulator with tutorial-like articles, can be found at [alien-project.gitbook.io/docs](https://alien-project.gitbook.io/docs). Please notice that many of the information therein are no longer up to date.
The latest version includes a brief documentation and user guidance in the program itself via help windows and tooltips.

# üñ•Ô∏è Minimal system requirements
An Nvidia graphics card with compute capability 6.0 or higher is needed. Please check [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported).

# üíΩ Installer
Installer for Windows: [alien-installer.msi](https://alien-project.org/media/files/alien-installer.msi) (Updated: 2024-04-22)

In the case that the program crashes for an unknown reason, please refer to the troubleshooting section in [alien-project.org/downloads.html](https://alien-project.org/downloads.html).

# üî® How to build the sources
The build process is mostly automated using the cross-platform CMake build system and the vcpkg package manager, which is included as a Git submodule.

### Getting the sources
To obtain the sources, please open a command prompt in a suitable directory (which should not contain whitespace characters) and enter the following command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chrxh/alien.git
```
Note: The `--recursive` parameter is necessary to check out the vcpkg submodule as well. Besides that, submodules are not normally updated by the standard `git pull` command. Instead, you need to write `git pull --recurse-submodules`.

### Build instructions
Prerequisites: [CUDA Toolkit 11.2+](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) and a toolchain for CMake (e.g. GCC 9.x+ or [MSVC v142+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/free-developer-offers/)).
There are reported compile issues with GCC 13 at the moment. Please use GCC 12 instead if you intend to use GCC.

Build steps:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build . --config Release -j8
```
If everything goes well, the ALIEN executable can be found under the build directory in `./alien` or `.\Release\alien.exe` depending on the used toolchain and platform.
It is important to start ALIEN directly from the build folder, otherwise it will not find the resource folder.

# ‚å®Ô∏è Command-line interface

This repository also contains a CLI for ALIEN. It can be used to run simulations without using a GUI. This is useful for performance measurements as well as for automatic execution and evaluation of simulations for different parameters.
The CLI takes the simulation file, along with its parameters and the number of time steps, as input. It then provides the resulting simulation file and the statistics (as a CSV file) as output.
For example,
```
.\cli.exe -i example.sim -o output.sim -t 1000
```
runs the simulation file `example.sim` for 1000 time steps.
